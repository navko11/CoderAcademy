Mark Navarro - Portfolio description

The purpose of the portfolio website is to present the skills, knowledge and experience in web development which is showcased on the website. A general introduction of myself is also included for viewers to get an idea of my occupational status, location and interests. 


My portfolio functions and features are designed to target employers, clients and developers. Depending on the features the portfolio will bring, it may follow with employment, new relations and collaboration projects for the future.


The website portfolio is constructed in VScode using only HTML and CSS with various components and properties which adjust to the view of any device being used. VScode extenstions have been used to support the progress of building the website. Certain parts of the website have been enhanced with CSS to have a responsive effect to give some "life" while navigating through the pages.
